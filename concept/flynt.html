              &quot;Concept art</a></i>                  is first of all an art of which the material is <i>concepts, 
                  </i> as the material of e.g. music is sound. Since concepts 
                  are closely bound up with language, concept art is a kind of 
                  art of which the material is language.&quot;</p>

              Henry Flynt originated the notion of concept art and practices the 
              most austere version of it. Other conceptual artists dealt with 
              theatrical events (Brecht, Vautier), with generic visual descriptions 
              (LeWitt, Weiner), or with the philosophy of art (Kosuth, <i>Art 
              &amp; Language</i>). Flynt's work, however, is concerned with a 
              new, non-deterministic form of mathematics.<br>

                Concept art was meant to replace all of mathematics with an 
                endeavor which involved a Rorschach-blot semantics; and which 
                did not claim to be cognitive, at least not in the inherited sense. 
                Mathematics had already been disconnected from claims of realism; 
                and I was extending that disavowal to a disconnection from claims 
                of a priori truth. Concept art's value consisted in beauty, a 
                beauty which was non-sentimental. Later I would say that its value 
                consisted in "the invention of new mental abilities." Popularity 
                had nothing to do with whether this avenue was worth taking. With 
                that background, it was easy for people to object that concept 
                art had nothing to do with art. At the end of the original concept 
                art essay, I offered that thought myself. My observation was quoted 
                by the reviewer of An Anthology in the Times Literary Supplement 
                of August 6, 1964.[1] Admittedly, concept art does not belong 
                to a traditional artistic branch or medium (e.g. painting), and 
                it is not pictorially sentimental. On the other hand, there is 
                a very strong tradition in mathematics which claims artistic value 
                for mathematics (in effect). What is more, there was a period 
                in which "serious music" became intellectually pretentious and 
                nonsentimental--and the serious music establishment backed this 
                development. </span></p>

              <p align="left"> <span class="serifbody">Dutch mathematician L.E.J. Brouwer in <i>"Consciousness, Philosophy, 
                and Mathematics"</i>: &quot;... the fullest constructional beauty 
                is the introspective beauty of mathematics, where instead of elements 
                of playful causal acting, the basic intuition of mathematics is 
                left to free unfolding. This unfolding is not bound to the exterior 
                world, and thereby to finiteness and responsibility; consequently 
                its introspective harmonies can attain any degree of richness 
                and clearness.&quot;</span></p>
              <p align="left" class="serifbody"> I saw an analogy between the syntax which metamathematics arrived 
                at, and the computational character, or derivational process character, 
                of much new music. It was also evident that Young's word pieces 
                concerned the metasyntax of music. [Not using the rules that define 
                music, but twisting the rules.] The original concept art was a 
                genre which used visual displays or process objects or text. It 
                was a genre of syntax, or of derivational process. The notion 
                that the sort of structure which subtended mathematics could have 
                aesthetic value was already established from ancient times for 
                mathematics; and it had been proclaimed for new music. </p>
              <p align="left" class="serifbody">Concept art was meant to exhibit syntactical structures which 
                broke the framework of objectification. We find that for the first 
                time ever, I used a perceptual illusion as a logical notation. 
                I relativized the existence of a derivation to the perceptual 
                agility of the "knowing subject" or "viewer." <br>
                <br>
                Mathematics had to have been projected onto its logical tree-structure 
                so that this tree-structure could then be manipulated in a blind 
                and cruel way &#150;&#150; &agrave; la Tzara and Cage. I have 
                cited Tzara's recipe for making a Dadaist poem. One may pass directly 
                from that to my exposition of "Haphazard System" in <i>Blueprint 
                for a Higher Civilization,</i> pp. 97-99. </p>
              <p align="left"><span class="serifbody"> My positioning of the concept-art venture in the Sixties took 
                some peculiar turns. As I said, as of 1961, I had no hesitation 
                about committing to art. Mathematical cognition had been replaced 
                by the search for uncanny structure, for ideas such that the possibility 
                of thinking them at all was amazing. The defensible value of the 
                enterprise, I thought, was aesthetic. Thus it was that all of 
                mathematics and all of art (mainly music) which had syntactical 
                pretensions were to be collapsed to a new genre of art. It was 
                right to call it art, not "science." Even so, at the end of the 
                concept art essay, I noted that concept art was entirely unsentimental, 
                and I forthrightly acknowledged that that cast doubt on the appropriateness 
                of classifying it as art. (. . .) Then, around 1966, there began 
                a long period in which I revisited concept art; and reworked it 
                discursively. (As investigations in formal language and in models 
                of inconsistent theories &#150;&#150; to put it in the jargon 
                which my work seeks to supplant.) <br>
