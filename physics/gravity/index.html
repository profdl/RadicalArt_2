            <p align="left" class="serifbody">Because we are accustomed every moment to 
              observe the difficulty with which things are raised in opposition 
              to the impulse of gravity; the idea of ascending always implies 
              the notion of force exerted in overcoming this difficulty; the conception 
              of which invigorates and elevates the thought, after the same mannner 
              as a grand object, and thus gives a distance above us much more 
              an appearance of greatness, than the same space could have in any 
              other direction. The sensation of amplitude, which by this means 
              comes to attend the interposed distance, is transferred to, and 
              considered as excited by the object that is eminent and above us; 
              and that object, by this transference, acquires grandeur and sublimity. 
            </p>
            <p align="right">Gerard 
              (1759), summarizing a section from Hume (1739-1740) </p>
            <p align="left" class="serifbody"><br>
              "The simplest form of external grandeur appears 
              in the vast and boundless prospects presented to us by nature; such 
              as wide extended plains, to which the eye can see no limits; the 
              firmament of heaven; or the boundless expanse of the ocean. All 
              vastness produces the impression of sublimity. It is to be remarked, 
              however, that space, extended in length, makes not so strong an 
              impression as height or depth. Though a boundless plain be a grand 
              object, yet a high mountain, to which we look up, or an awful precipice 
              or tower whence we look down on the objects which lie below, is 
              still more so." <br>
"In the feeble attempts, which human art can make towards producing 
              grand objects (feeble, I mean, in comparison with the powers of 
              nature), greatness of dimensions always constitutes a principal 
              part. (...) A gothic cathedral raises ideas of grandeur in our minds, 
              by its size, its height, its awful obscurity, its strength, its 
              antiquity, and its durability." </p>

            <p align="left" class="serifbody">Now the whole earth had one language and 
              few words. And as men migrated from the east, they found a plain 
              in the land of Shinar and settled there. And they said to one another, 
              'Come, let us make bricks, and burn them thoroughly.' And they had 
              brick for stone, and bitumen for mortar. Then they said, 'Come, 
              let us build ourselves a city, and a tower with its top in the heavens, 
              and let us make a name for ourselves, lest we be scattered abroad 
              upon the face of the whole earth.' And the Lord came down to see 
              the city and the tower, which the sons of men had built. And the 
              Lord said, 'Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language; 
              and this is only the beginning of what they will do; and nothing 
              that they propose to do will now be impossible for them. Come, let 
              us go down, and there confuse their language, that they may not 
              understand one another's speech.' So the Lord scattered them abroad 
              from there over the face of all the earth, and they left off building 
              the city.' Therefore its name was called Babel, because there the 
              Lord confused the language of all the earth; and from there the 
              Lord scattered them abroad over the face of all the earth. </p>

              From that day on this has been the motto 
              of humanity, "let us make a name for ourselves." I am always amused 
              to see how many public edifices made a plaque somewhere on which 
              the names of all the public officials who were in power when it 
              was built are inscribed: the mayor, the head of public works, etc. 
              "Let us make a name for ourselves," is a fundamental urge of a fallen 
              race. It reveals one of the basic philosophies of humanism: "Glory 
              to man in the highest, for man is the master of things." That is 
              the central thought of humanism, glory to mankind. The fact that 
              this was a religious tower &#150; and yet built to make a name for 
              man &#150; reveals the master motive behind religion. It is a means 
              by which man attempts to share the glory of God. We must understand 
              this, otherwise we will never understand the power of religion as 
              it has pervaded the earth and permeated our culture ever since. 
              It is a way by which man seeks to share what is rightfully God's 
              alone.</p>

        <td>          <blockquote><h4 align="left"><i>Galileo: Observing gravity</i></h4>
            <p align="justify"><br>
              The most famous demonstrations of gravity at work may have been 
                performed by Galileo Galilei around 1590. They are prominently mentioned in a sketch of Galileo's life by his disciple Vincenzo Viviani:</p>
            <p align="justify" class="SerifBodyIndent"><i>&quot;Aristotle</i> taught that mobile objects of the same material and different 
                weight, when moved through the same medium, receive velocities <i>proportional</i> to their weights. <i>Galileo</i> claimed, 
                however, that they had to move with the same velocity, and demonstrated 
                this with many <i>experiments, </i>which he performed from the 
              Clock-Tower in Pisa in the presence of many professors and students.&quot;</p>
            <p align="justify"> In Galileo's manuscript <em>De Motu Antiquiora</em>, we find more details about the experiments he carried out. To dismiss Aristotle's motion laws, he did in fact not need experiments: he established their intrinsic absurdity  by reasoning about simple &quot;thought experiments&quot;. But he also described  observations of the motions of a lead sphere and an equally large wooden sphere, which are dropped simultaneously. The wooden sphere </p>
            <p align="justify" class="SerifBodyIndent">&quot;... moves more swiftly than lead in the beginning of its motion; but a little later the motion of the lead is so accelerated that it leaves the wood behind it. And if they are both let fall from a high tower, the lead moves far out in front. This is something I have often tested.&quot; </p>
            <p align="justify">The higher speed of the heavier object points to the role of the densities of the falling materials, which Galileo at that time took to be <em>the</em> cause of all spontaneous vertical motion. The head start of the lighter object is less obvious; it was explained much later, when Thomas Settle (1983) showed that a human experimenter tends to release the lighter object more quickly, because it is gripped with less force than the heavier object. </p>
            <p align="justify">Galileo's 
                experiments with falling bodies achieved a legendary status in the 
            history of science. Taking Viviani's account as a point of departure, later biographies of Galileo  added increasing amounts of fictional detail in their accounts, and exaggerated the scale and the impact of the events. More careful historians have of course noted this, and have also pointed out that  Viviani's Galileo-bio cannot be taken at face-value, since it was written 60 years after these purported happenings, in a spirit of uncritical admiration and over-enthusiastic propaganda. Many   maintain therefore that the Pisa droppings never took place. (Cf. Wohlwill, 1905; Cooper, 1935; Segre, 1989; Martinez, 2011.) Galileo's unambiguous statement in <em>De Motu</em>, however, suggests that these authors err on the side of skepticism. Bertoloni Meli (2006, p. 56): <em>&quot;... in all likelihood Galileo repeatedly dropped balls from high places such as the leaning tower of Pisa; lack of additional contemporary records may be attributed to the fact that such public events and disputations were rather common at Pisa and possibly elsewhere.&quot;</em></p>
            <p align="justify">Note that Galileo's Pisa experiments were not merely scientific experiments in the modern sense of that word. They were also <i>demo's</i>, serving a communicative purpose: persuading  colleagues and teaching 
                     students. The myhthical experiments, as Viviani viewed them, were certainly remarkable. In teaching, they replaced 
                    abstract description by vivid demonstration. In empirical science 
                    they created a perfect peer review system, which allows researchers 
                    direct access to each other's observations. And research and teaching 
                    were integrated; students and professors were invited at the same 
                    time; the university became one scientific community. Finally, the 
                    choice of a monumental and visible site for the experiments created 
                    a cultural presence in the city at large, encouraging knowledge 
                    dissemination beyond the boundaries of the academic scene. <i><br>

            <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The dramatic effect of gravity on material bodies has become a ubiquitous 
                symbol of our inexorable subjugation to the inhuman, unchangeable 
                laws of nature. This theme reverberates throughout the history of 
                art, in many different ways.<br>
              <br>
              The most profound reflection on this matter is no doubt Marcel Duchamp's &quot;3 Stoppages &Eacute;talon&quot;. It is a performance piece 
                  which looks like a pastiche on a scientific experiment: A thread 
                  with a length of 1 meter is dropped onto a flat surface from a height 
                  of 1 meter. It is fixed exactly in the position in which it lands 
                  on the surface, and this shape becomes the model for a new, crooked 
              &quot;standard meter&quot;. This procedure is repeated 3 times. 
                  Duchamp thus applies a destructive test procedure to the unit of 
                  measurement itself. The transformation of the standard distance 
                  alludes to the notion of Lorenz contraction and to Einstein's theories 
                  of relativity; the random character of the transformation evokes 
                  the <i>klinamen</i> in the world view of Demokritus, and the measurement 
                  notion of modern quantum theory. But Duchamp's suggestion is more 
                  radical. He is not proposing new complexities in physical theory; 
                  by twisting the prototypical unit of measurement, he problematizes 
                  the very notion of scientific knowledge. He frees the mind from 
                  the tatters of matter by suggesting that the so-called laws of nature 
                  may very well not exist, or that they are irrelevant because unknowable. 
                  What we think we know are mere conventions; every statement is false. 
                  Duchamp's attitude is very close to the scepticism of Pyrrho and 
                  other pre-Socratic philosophers. &quot;3 Stoppages &Eacute;talon&quot; is a stark and yet complex expression of this scepticism.<br>
                <br>
              The sophistication of Duchamp's work remains exceptional. Other 
              modern art which takes up the theme of gravity assumes a more naieve 
              mind-frame; it accepts or denies the laws of physics without challenging 
              them conceptually. Andy Warhol's <i>Suicide</i> paintings thus acknowledge 
                  the operation of gravity on the human body in a postmodern, deadpan 
                  fashion. The other extreme is represented by Yves Klein's &quot;Jump 
                  into the Void&quot;, which revives the age-old fantasy</font> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">of 
                  overcoming the laws of nature through sheer magic.<br>

            <p align="left">The serene detachment of science is subverted into 
              Faustian hybris when science turns into technology. In the twentieth 
              century, the airplane and the spaceship came to symbolize technology's 
              ultimate seduction: they promise to transport us into the realm 
              of freedom by exploiting the very laws of nature that always constrained 
              us. Some visionary artists were encouraged by these technological 
              developments, but they were not willing or able to proceed as humble 
              engineers &#150; they needed shortcuts. Thus, Malevich (1920) wrote 
              about space travel by means of a completely novel technology which 
              was supposedly emerging from his new approach to painting. <br>

              In his famous fake performance <i> Le saut dans le vide</i> (1960), 
              Yves Klein demonstrated he could fly by sheer magic. He also maintained 
            that this would be a viable method for space travel:</p>
            <p align="left" class="SerifBodyIndent">&quot;Neither 
                missiles nor rockets nor sputniks will render man the "conquistador" of space. Those means derive only from the phantom of today's 
                scientists who still live in the romantic and sentimental spirit 
                of the XIX century. Man will only be able to take possession of 
                space through the terrifying forces, the ones imprinted with peace 
                and sensibility. He will be able to conquer space - truly his 
                greatest desire - only after having realized the impregnation 
             of space by his own sensibility.&quot; </p>
            <p align="left" class="SerifBodyIndent">&quot;Today anyone who paints space must actually go into space 
                to paint, but he must go there without any faking, and neither 
                in an aeroplane, a parachute, or a rocket: he must go there by 
            his own means, by an autonomous, individual force.&quot; </p>

            <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since the 1920's, many cinematic artworks have questioned the hybris 
                of our culture in an entertaining way, by demonstrating our ineffectiveness 
                in overcoming the power of gravity. Bruce Conner made a very effective 
                collage movie of an airplane which keeps crashing forever. Bas-Jan 
                Ader made a series of performance documentaries in which he can be 
                seen falling from a tree, falling from the roof of his house in Claremont, 
                and riding his bicycle into a canal in Amsterdam. A recent example 
                in this tradition is the video installation <i>Go Up! Go Up!</i> by 
            Hu Jie Ming. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Panamarenko is interested in flying and space travel, and he is more 
                serious about it than Malevich and Klein were. Operating in the context 
                of science and technology as we know them, he rethinks the motion 
                laws and designs alternative technologies &#150;&#150; and fails conspicuously. His theories don't compute, and his airplanes don't fly.<i><br>

            <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The prototypical sculpture is a statue, affirming the upright stature 
              of the human animal.  The prototypical sculpture is 
              vertical. (Brancusi.) Carl Andre's floor sculptures are unique in that they accept gravity 
              in a deadpan, down-to-earth way. <br>
              <br>
              The art of process and anti-form also embraces gravity: to <a href="../../informe/hang/index.html">hang</a>, 
                to <a href="../../process/drop/index.html">drop</a>, to <a href="http://radicalart.info/process/pour/index.html">pour</a>. 
                A particularly provocative instance of this approach is the suspension 
                of human persons: the person turns from an active agent into a passive 
                object. Stelarc's early work demonstrates this in a pointed way.<br>

              Abolishing Gravity</i></h4>
            <p align="left">Archimedes' principle provides a way to &quot;abolish&quot; 
              gravity: by suspending objects in a liquid with the same specific 
              weight. (One creates an environment where an upward force consistently 
              and perfectly compensates the earth's downward pull.) Jeff Koons 
              and Damien Hirst have used this method in pieces which allude to 
              the lost harmony of our floating existence in our original habitat 
            &#150; where  there is no strife, and where 
                earth, fire and air don't exist.<br>
              <br>
              Floating may be faked by applying external forces in an invisible 
            way &#150; for instance, by moving air or by magnetic attraction/repulsion. 
                The simplest version consists in suspending ping pong balls in an 
                air flow. This approach, which turns the heavy-duty gravity issue 
                into a joke, has been applied by the New Electric Chamber Music 
                Ensemble, Hans Haacke, Wim T. Schippers, and Damien Hirst.</p>
