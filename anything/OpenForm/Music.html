            Classical composers do not make music &#150; they 
              write scores which specify the scenarios followed by performing 
              artists who create actual sonic structures. Composers could thus 
              choose an extremely modest interpretation of their role. Since they 
              trust the creativity of their performers, they could be content 
              to view themselves as mere providers of material, without necessarily 
              anticipating how the performer would use it, or entertaining expectations 
              about the eventually resulting sounds. Since the early 1960's, this 
              manner of composing has been been practiced in several different 
          ways. Examples are:</p>
                <blockquote> 
                  <ul>
                    <li> &nbsp;Graphic scores whose interpretation 
                  is partially or completely unspecified. The most radical proponent 
                  of this genre is Anastesis Logothetis. The anthology <i>Notations</i>, 
                  edited by John Cage, provides examples from many composers.</li>
                 <li>
                <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Meta-scores&quot; with 
                  an infinite variety of structurally different realisations, from 
                  which the performer may choose at his own discretion. A very complex 
                  example is Plus-Minus by Karlheinz Stockhausen.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Word pieces&quot;: generic 
                  verbal descriptions of musical events. This genre was practiced 
                  by George Brecht, La Monte Young, Henry Flynt, Dick Higgins, George 
                  Maciunas, and other composers associated with the International 
                  Fluxus Movement.<br>
                  Some of these pieces do not specify any constraints. And some 
                  are impossible to perform; that is when music becomes <a href="../../concept/index.html">concept 
                  art</a>. </p>
              </li>
            </ul>

          <p align="left">Sometimes, the transfer of the composer's authority 
            to the performer's autonomy symbolizes a political stance. John Cage, 
            one of the most enthusiastic advocates of <i>indeterminacy,</i> was 
            a card-carrying anarchist.<br>

            Interactivity</h5>
          <p align="left">One may also organize a musical performance so as 
              to allow the public to exercise a decisive influence on its course. 
              The first such &quot;interactive&quot; pieces were developed in the 
              context of post-serial non-deterministic music. (Henri Pousseur's 
            &quot;Votre Faust&quot; involves a &quot;voting machine&quot;). <br>
            <br>
            In a much less formal way, the &quot;happenings&quot; by Allan Kaprow 
              and others also allow more audience interaction than traditional music 
              or theatre. In some concerts by <a href="http://iaaa.nl/rs/NewElectric/index.html">The New Electric Chamber Music Ensemble</a>            (1966), members of the audience completely took over the stage in the course of the evening.<br>
