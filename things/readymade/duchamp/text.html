            <p align="left" class="serifbody">Mr. Richard Mutt sent in a fountain. Without discussion this article 
                  disappeared and was never exhibited. </p>
            <p align="left" class="serifbody">What were the grounds for refusing Mr. Mutt's fountain:</p>
            <p align="left" class="serifbody"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Some contend it was immoral, vulgar. <br>
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Others, it was plagiarism, a plain piece of plumbing. </p>
              <p align="left"><span class="serifbody">Now Mr. Mutt's fountain is not immoral, that is absurd, no more 
                than a bath tub is immoral. It is a fixture that you see every 
              day in plumbers' show windows. </span></p>
              <p align="left"><span class="serifbody">Whether Mr. Mutt with his own hands made the fountain or not has 
                  no importance. He CHOSE it. He took an ordinary article of life, 
                  placed it so that its useful significance disappeared under a 
                  new title and point of view &#150; created a new thought for that 
              object.</span></p>
              <p align="left"><span class="serifbody">As for plumbing, that is absurd. The only works of art America

            <p align="center" class="serif"><font size="+2">THE CREATIVE ACT</font> <b><br>
              <br>
              by Marcel Duchamp </b></p>
            <p align="left"><br>
              <span class="serifbody">Let us consider two important factors, the two poles of the creation 
              of art: the artist on the one hand, and on the other the spectator 
              who later becomes the posterity. </span></p>
            <p align="left" class="serifbody">To all appearances, the artist acts like a mediumistic being who, 
              from the labyrinth beyond time and space, seeks his way out to a 
              clearing. If we give the attributes of a medium to the artist, we 
              must then deny him the state of consciousness on the esthetic plane 
              about what he is doing or why he is doing it. All his decisions 
              in the artistic execution of the work rest with pure intuition and 
              cannot be translated into a self-analysis, spoken or written, or 
              even thought out. </p>
            <p align="left" class="serifbody">T.S. Eliot, in his essay on "Tradition and Individual Talent", 
              writes: "The more perfect the artist, the more completely separate 
              in him will be the man who suffers and the mind which creates; the 
              more perfectly will the mind digest and transmute the passions which 
              are its material." </p>
            <p align="left" class="serifbody">Millions of artists create; only a few thousands are discussed 
              or accepted by the spectator and many less again are consecrated 
              by posterity. </p>
            <p align="left" class="serifbody">In the last analysis, the artist may shout from all the rooftops 
              that he is a genius: he will have to wait for the verdict of the 
              spectator in order that his declarations take a social value and 
              that, finally, posterity includes him in the primers of Artist History. 
            </p>
            <p align="left" class="serifbody">I know that this statement will not meet with the approval of many 
              artists who refuse this mediumistic role and insist on the validity 
              of their awareness in the creative act &#150; yet, art history has 
              consistently decided upon the virtues of a work of art through considerations 
              completely divorced from the rationalized explanations of the artist. </p>
            <p align="left" class="serifbody">If the artist, as a human being, full of the best intentions toward 
              himself and the whole world, plays no role at all in the judgment 
              of his own work, how can one describe the phenomenon which prompts 
              the spectator to react critically to the work of art? In other words, 
              how does this reaction come about? </p>
            <p align="left" class="serifbody">This phenomenon is comparable to a transference from the artist 
              to the spectator in the form of an esthetic osmosis taking place 
              through the inert matter, such as pigment, piano or marble. </p>
            <p align="left" class="serifbody">But before we go further, I want to clarify our understanding of 
              the word 'art' - to be sure, without any attempt at a definition. 
            </p>
            <p align="left" class="serifbody">What I have in mind is that art may be bad, good or indifferent, 
              but, whatever adjective is used, we must call it art, and bad art 
              is still art in the same way that a bad emotion is still an emotion. 
            </p>
            <p align="left" class="serifbody">Therefore, when I refer to 'art coefficient', it will be understood 
              that I refer not only to great art, but I am trying to describe 
              the subjective mechanism which produces art in the raw state &#150; 
              <i>&agrave; l'&eacute;tat brut </i>&#150; bad, good or indifferent. </p>
            <p align="left" class="serifbody">In the creative act, the artist goes from intention to realization 
              through a chain of totally subjective reactions. His struggle toward 
              the realization is a series of efforts, pains, satisfaction, refusals, 
              decisions, which also cannot and must not be fully self-conscious, 
              at least on the esthetic plane. </p>
            <p align="left" class="serifbody">The result of this struggle is a difference between the intention 
              and its realization, a difference which the artist is not aware 
              of. </p>
            <p align="left" class="serifbody">Consequently, in the chain of reactions accompanying the creative 
              act, a link is missing. This gap, representing the inability of 
              the artist to express fully his intention, this difference between 
              what he intended to realize and did realize, is the personal 'art 
              coefficient' contained in the work. </p>
            <p align="left" class="serifbody">In other words, the personal 'art coefficient' is like an arithmetical 
              relation between the unexpressed but intended and the unintentionally 
              expressed. </p>
            <p align="left" class="serifbody">To avoid a misunderstanding, we must remember that this 'art coefficient' 
              is a personal expression of art <i>&agrave; l'&eacute;tat brut,</i> 
              that is, still in a raw state, which must be 'refined' as pure sugar 
              from molasses by the spectator; the digit of this coefficient has 
              no bearing whatsoever on his verdict. The creative act takes another 
              aspect when the spectator experiences the phenomenon of transmutation: 
              through the change from inert matter into a work of art, an actual 
              transubtantiation has taken place, and the role of the spectator 
              is to determine the weight of the work on the esthetic scale. </p>
            <p align="left" class="serifbody">All in all, the creative act is not performed by the artist alone; 
              the spectator brings the work in contact with the external world 
              by deciphering and interpreting its inner qualification and thus 
              adds his contribution to the creative act. This becomes even more 
              obvious when posterity gives a final verdict and sometimes rehabilitates 
              forgotten artists. </p>

          <blockquote> 
            <blockquote> 
              <p align="left"><span class="serifbody">IN 1913 I HAD THE HAPPY IDEA TO FASTEN A BICYCLE WHEEL TO 
                A KITCHEN STOOL AND WATCH IT TURN. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A FEW MONTHS LATER I BOUGHT 
                A CHEAP REPRODUCTION OF A WINTER EVENING LANDSCAPE, WHICH I CALLED 
                "PHARMACY" AFTER ADDING TWO SMALL DOTS, ONE RED AND ONE YELLOW, 
                IN THE HORIZON. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IN NEW YORK IN 1915 I BOUGHT 
                AT A HARDWARE STORE A SNOW SHOVEL ON WHICH I WROTE "IN ADVANCE 
                OF THE BROKEN ARM." <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IT WAS AROUND THAT TIME THAT 
                THE WORD <i>READYMADE</i> CAME TO MIND TO DESIGNATE THIS FORM 
                OF MANIFESTATION.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A POINT WHICH I WANT VERY 
                MUCH TO ESTABLISH IS THAT THE CHOICE OF THESE "READYMADES" WAS 
                NEVER DICTATED BY ESTHETIC DELECTATION. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THIS CHOICE WAS BASED ON 
                A REACTION OF VISUAL INDIFFERENCE WITH AT THE SAME TIME A TOTAL 
                ABSENCE OF GOOD OR BAD TASTE &ndash; IN FACT A COMPLETE ANESTHESIA.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ONE IMPORTANT CHARACTERISTIC 
                WAS THE SHORT SENTENCE WHICH I OCCASIONALLY INSCRIBED ON THE "READYMADE." 
                <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THAT SENTENCE INSTEAD OF 
                DESCRIBING THE OBJECT LIKE A TITLE WAS MEANT TO CARRY THE MIND 
                OF THE SPECTATOR TOWARDS OTHER REGIONS MORE VERBAL. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SOMETIMES I WOULD ADD A GRAPHIC 
                DETAIL OF PRESENTATION WHICH IN ORDER TO SATISFY MY CRAVING FOR 
                ALLITERATIONS, WOULD BE CALLED "READYMADE AIDED." <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AT ANOTHER TIME WANTING TO 
                EXPOSE THE BASIC ANTINOMY BETWEEN ART AND READYMADES I IMAGINED 
                A "RECIPROCAL READYMADE": USE A REMBRANDT AS AN IRONING BOARD! <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I REALIZED VERY SOON THE 
                DANGER OF REPEATING INDISCRIMINATELY THIS FORM OF EXPRESSION AND 
                DECIDED TO LIMIT THE PRODUCTION OF "READYMADES" TO A SMALL NUMBER 
                YEARLY. I WAS AWARE AT THAT TIME, THAT FOR THE SPECTATOR EVEN 
                MORE THAN FOR THE ARTIST, ART IS A HABIT-FORMING DRUG AND I WANTED 
                TO PROTECT MY "READYMADES" AGAINST SUCH CONTAMINATION. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ANOTHER ASPECT OF THE "READYMADE" 
                IS ITS LACK OF UNIQUENESS. . . THE REPLICA OF THE "READYMADE" 
                DELIVERING THE SAME MESSAGE; IN FACT NEARLY EVERY ONE OF THE "READYMADES" EXISTING TODAY IS NOT AN ORIGINAL IN THE CONVENTIONAL SENSE.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A FINAL REMARK TO THIS EGOMANIAC'S 
                DISCOURSE: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SINCE THE TUBES OF PAINT 
                USED BY AN ARTIST ARE MANUFACTURED AND READY MADE PRODUCTS WE 
                MUST CONCLUDE THAT ALL THE PAINTINGS IN THE WORLD ARE "READYMADES 
                AIDED" AND ALSO WORKS OF ASSEMBLAGE. <br>
