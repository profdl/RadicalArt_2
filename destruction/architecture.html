            <p align="left" class="serifbody">Baron Haussmann called himself an "artiste d&eacute;molisseur." I intend to write the book that we missed on our bookshelves: 
                  next to all the studies on artists and architects, creators of 
                  all sorts of beautiful things, the one study on famous demolishers. </p>                        <p align="left" class="serifbody">Demolishing a building 
                is nothing but the undoing of the construction process. More and 
                more, architecture has been given an economical duration, the 
                same way other "durable" goods have been determined to live as 
                long as they are not in the way of new products. Automobiles end 
                up in the crusher, but where does a building go? Artistic demolishers, 
                such as the Loizeaux family of Phoenix, near Baltimore, Maryland, 
                who work with finely dosaged explosives, prepare their victims 
                in the manner of a Philippine chicken: carefully removing all 
                critical structural elements before placing the charges. When 
                the blast comes, gravity is allowed to do the rest, bringing down 
                the building in an elegant fashion, quietly imploding it, burying 
                it under its own dust. Demolition is nothing but terminating the 
                life cycle of buildings with dynamite and gravity. Columns of 
                steel, created by fire, riveted or welded with fire, then protected 
                against fire, are finally brought down with fire. The spark of 
                a small fuse sets off an explosion in which the long-lasting fires 
                of destruction of the past are compacted into a brief but infinitely 
                more devastating blast of dynamite. Buildings the size of cities 
                can be brought down in seconds. The first, and still the tallest, 
                building ever to be imploded was the thirty-two-story Mendez Caldera 
                Building in Sao Paulo. In 1975, it was leveled with the help of 
                a mere thousand pounds of charges in a few seconds. </p>            <p align="left" class="serifbody">A plea for selective 
                artistic destruction will engage "Columns of Fire" in popular 
                debate. Does not the fire of the forest fertilize the earth for 
                new growth? Why are we made to believe that architecture is permanent, 
                that matter is forever, and that the old is like a bridge not 
                to be burned? From an aesthetic point of view the removal of architectural 
                eyesores by selective destruction should be regarded as an act 
                of artistic creativity. As for now, we still have to wait for 
                the first Grand Prix de Rome to be awarded to the creative genius 
                that will dynamite the Paris Tour du Montparnasse.</p>            <p align="right"><font face="Verdana">Thomas van Leeuwen:
