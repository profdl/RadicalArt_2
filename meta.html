          Kant: Nature versus art</h3>
          <div align="left">
            <blockquote>
              <p class="serifbody"><font face="Georgia, serif">Immanuel Kant&#146;s classic <i>Kritik 
              der Urteilskraft </i>analyses the esthetic experience as a cognitive 
              phenomenon: a feature of perception which is manifested when perception 
              becomes conscious of itself -- when the process of input interpretation 
              does not yield a definite final result, but nevertheless creates a 
              coherent experience. <br>
              <br>
              For today's reader<i>, </i>it is striking that Kant&#146;s discussion 
              is <i>not</i> primarily concerned with works of art, but with natural 
              phenomena -- his paradigm examples evoke flowers, crystals, landscapes, 
              stormy seas and starry skies. This is not a coincidence; it is connected 
              with essential properties of Kant&#146;s theory. In his view, the 
              esthetic experience presupposes a <i>disinterested</i> attitude, which 
              does not involve any practical purposes. It is the awareness of autonomous 
              perceptual processes which analyse and reanalyse their input in a 
              playful manner, without trying to grasp it under a determinate concept.<br>

          <p align="left" class="serifbody"><font face="Georgia, serif"> Manmade artworks have an inherently 
            problematic status in Kant&#146;s theory. Western highbrow art seems 
            to agree with this point of view, in that it has increasingly emphasized 
            its practical uselessness. But this very uselessness signals a purpose: 
            the artwork is deliberately constructed to be experienced in the esthetic 
            mode, i.e., to be experienced as if it does not have any purpose. 
            This deliberateness must be ignored, if we are to experience the artwork 
            in an esthetic way. Kant noticed this problem, and concluded that 
            art necessarily involves a second-order mimesis: whatever the artwork 
            does or does not portray, it must always fake its &quot;natural&quot; character:<i> &quot;. . . the finality in the product of fine art, 
            although it is intentional, must nevertheless not seem to be intentional."</i> 
            [...]<i> "Nature proved beautiful, when it looked at the same time 
            as art; art can only be called beautiful, when we are conscious of 
            its being art, and yet it looks to us as nature."</i><br>
            <br>
            Perception is an abductive process. To interpret any product of a 
            human artist is to retrace the mental processes behind it. These processes 
            always involve the artist&#146;s ideas, methods, goals and motives. 
            The artists&#146;s fellow-humans cannot be expected to overlook that 
            content, or to deal with it in a disinterested fashion. Manmade art 
            thus constitutes sub-optimal input for the process of esthetic reflection. 
            Twentieth-century art-critics have not failed to notice this implication 
            of Kant&#146;s theory; and some of them have pointed at contingent 
            but ubiquitous features of manmade artworks, which increase their 
            discrepancy with his esthetic ideal.</font></p>

                way to music which is composed and performed by humans? Human composers 
                and musicians are not disinterested. They want money, fame, sex. 
                They cannot hide this, and often they don&#146;t even try. If we 
                do not turn off our microphones when we listen to their pieces, 
                we hear greed, jealousy, lust. Behind the apparent complexity and 
                indefiniteness of their compositions, there are all too clear-cut 
              meanings.&quot;</i> </font></p>

          <p align="left"><span class="serifbody"><font face="Georgia, serif">Esthetically motivated art thus faces 
            a curious challenge: if it is created by humans, it will always be 
            inferior to nature! In the course of the twentieth century, this challenge 
            has been taken up by many artists. Some of them have suggested that 
            they <i>are</i> in fact natural forces, beyond the ken of ordinary 
            humans. Others have tried to withdraw from their artworks, by developing 
            objective art-generating processes which they initiate without controlling 
            the final result: chance art, <i>&eacute;criture automatique, </i>physical 
            experiments, mathematical calculations, biological processes.<br>

          Duchamp: The Readymade</h3>

              to exhibit them as art objects.&nbsp;A typical example is his 1914 
              Bottlerack. &nbsp;Duchamp thus drew a radical consequence from Kant's 
              point of view: that the input doesn't matter, as long as the observer's 
              process of esthetic reflection can take its course. </span></p>
            <blockquote>
              <p align="left"><span class="serifbody"><i>Clement Greenberg 
                was correct to observe that the whole Duchampian position was essentially 
                anticipated by the eighteenth-century notion of the "aesthetic attitude." Once it was recognized that anything whatsoever could be a work 
                of art if contemplated aesthetically, then presenting such objects 
                as Duchamp's <u>Fountain</u> in the museum merely involved drawing 
                the consequences of this Kantian position, though admittedly with 
                examples which would have bewildered Kant.</i></span></p>

        <blockquote><p align="left"><span class="serifbody">Duchamp's gesture may seem to celebrate 
            the sublime autonomous creative power of the artist's <i>Kunstwollen, 
            </i>but his pronouncement that <i>&quot;The spectator makes the picture&quot;</i> 
            suggests a different interpretation. It is true that Duchamp chose 
            his objects very carefully, but his judiciousness has a very peculiar 
            character.</span></p>
          <blockquote><p align="left"><span class="serifbody">Duchamp:<i> "It is very difficult to 
              choose an object, because after a few weeks you start to like it 
              or to hate it. You must approach a thing with indifference, as if 
              you have no esthetic emotion. The choice of readymades is always 
              based on visual indifference and, at the same time, on the complete 
              absence of good or bad taste."</i> </span></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p align="left"><span class="serifbody">The readymades are ordinary, 'neutral' 
            objects: schoolbook, coat-rack, hat-rack, bicycle-wheel, bottle-rack, 
            snow-shovel, plastic bucket, coffee grinder, typewriter-cover. Standard 
            objects, models from the drawing lesson. Like the chairs and tables which represent 'the object' in philosophical 
            discussions, Duchamp's readymades are 'free variables' &#150;&#150; 
            schemas that all other objects can substitute for, lacking specific 
            properties which would block unification. (The many racks and containers 
            among Duchamp&#146;s readymades do support another level of interpretation: 
            evoking their absent pendants            and fillers, they symbolize their 
            own status as &quot;placeholders&quot; in a self-referential way; 
            this is of course not incompatible with equally obvious Freudian readings.)<br>
            </span></p>
          <p align="left"><span class="serifbody">Duchamp asserts the esthetic interpretation 
            of everything. Esthetic perception is not tied to the art-context &#151; it has its origin and its justification in the observer, and 
            can be applied to arbitrary material. </span><span class="serifbody">To embrace Duchamp's esthetics 
              is to loose any reason to make one particular artwork rather than 
              another, or to make any artwork at all. The esthetic way of life does 
              not need art. The artwork has no special dignity any more, and art 
              history has lost its driving force. It did not take long before the end of art was proclaimed explicitly. 
          In 1921, Aleksandr Rodchenko exhibited 3 monochrome paintings, and 
          his companion Varvara Stepanova explained: &quot;From here, Constructivism 
              proceeds to the negation of all art in its entirety, and calls into 
              question the necessity of a specific activity of art to create a universal 
              aesthetic.&quot;<br>

        La Naus&eacute;e du Peintre 
        </h3>
        <blockquote><p align="left"> <span class="serifbody">For several decades, Duchamp's 
              readymades were dismissed as charming jokes, and Rodchenko's monochromes 
              were simply ignored. Modern art was blooming, and the end of art's history 
              seemed further away than ever. Constructivism, expressionism and surrealism 
              were successful start-up enterprises with big promises for the future, 
              presenting talented young artists with an abundance of exciting challenges. 
              No one needed the Pyrrhonian sophisms of artists without art. <br>
            <br>
            In the course of the 1950's, however, the dynamics of modern art starts 
            to get exhausted very quickly. With Jackson Pollock's gratuitous gestures 
            and Georges Mathieu's theatrical performances, the cult of subjective 
            expression has culminated in its own parody. Duchamp's cerebral hypotheses 
            have become living reality: the connoisseur's capacity to assign profound 
            meanings to arbitrary traces of human activity is overdeveloped to such 
            an extent, that any painting is as good as any other. The creative artist 
            who is aware of this, is overcome with a sickening sense of senselessness:

          <p align="left" class="serifbody">Many artists now embrace Duchamp's point

              and Nouveau R&eacute;alisme:  Stanley 
              Brouwn's shoe shops, George Brecht's <i>Events</i>, Arman's <i>Accumulations,</i> 
            Daniel Spoerri's <i>Tableaux-Pi&egrave;ges,</i> Christo's <i>Empaquetages</i>. 
              The esthetic validity of all and everything is asserted explicitly through 
              mirrors, glass windows, and socles which display the whole world. Alternatively, 
              the futile and superfluous nature of art is illustrated by means of 
              tautologies, paradoxes, monochrome paintings, empty frames, empty rooms 
              and closed galleries.<br>
            <br>
            Note that artworks of this sort hardly count as esthetic objects in 
            the Kantian sense of that word. They are statements with a literal meaning, 
            didactic and unambiguous. And sterile -- because, once the point has 
            been made, there is no reason to repeat it and no way to develop it. 
            They are self-defeating speech acts which kill the discourse that spawned 
            them. The end of art.<br>

                <p align="left" class="serifbody">The end of art was also a new beginning. 
                  Many of the artists who rejected the traditional art object

                  is a class of possibilities rather than an individual thing.

                  form&quot;</i>), a collection of building blocks (<i>interactivity</i>), 
                  a physical process (<i>process art</i>), a computer program 
                  (<i>algorithmic art</i>), or a mere idea (<i>concept art</i>). 
                  Jean Tinguely's<i> kinetic art</i> is another case in point.

                <p align="left"><span class="serifbody">Many of these approaches use some form of 
            non-determinism: the artist does not control the creation of the artwork, 
            but launches processes that yield unintended, unpredictable results. 
            Even the unconscious influence of the artist on the artwork, characteristic 
            for <i>&Eacute;criture Automatique</i> and <i>action painting</i>, is 
            given up. If there are human persons involved in the execution of the 
            work, they add a layer of random variation, not a layer of expressive 
            meaning.<br>
            <br>
            The most rigorous non-determinism is exercised in the formal approach 
            to meta-art which is known as Chance Art. (Cf. George Brecht, John Cage, 
            Ellsworth Kelly, Fran&ccedil;ois Morellet, Frieder Nake, Peter Struycken, 
            Zdenek Sykora, Herman de Vries.) The mathematical methods developed 
            here are particularly important for the future, because they can easily 
            be implemented on digital computers.<br>
            <br>
            It should be noted that the unpredictability of these approaches is 
            usually very limited. The framework established by the artist tends 
            to dominate the details which he relegates to social, psychological, 
            physical or mathematical contingencies. No <i>absolute</i> randomness, 
            but <i>form</i> at a new level of abstraction. <br>

                  <p align="left" class="serifbody">The esthetic interpretation 
                  of everything need not be limited to what we happen to encounter 
                  in the world as it is; it may include everything imagineable, 
                  all <i>possible</i> images. This observation creates an artistic 
                  challenge which has a philosophical dimension (how to define &quot;everything&quot;?), and a technical one (how to show it?). <br>
                  <br>
                  Is it possible to define the set of all possible art objects? 
                  Not in a very general way. But once we have specified a particular 
                  medium sufficiently explicitly, we have in fact specified a 
                  particular set of possible pieces. This is especially clear 
                  when we employ a digital medium. In this case, there is a mathematical 
                  enumeration of the set of possible outputs. Look, for instance, 
                  at a black-and-white screen with a particular resolution, say 
                  <i>m</i> x <i>n </i>pixels; the set of all possible images is 
                  then defined as the set generated by all combinations of choices 
                  of black vs. white for every pixel.<br>
                  <br>
                  A computer program that in principle generates all these possible 
                  images one by one, can be  constructed 
                  rather easily on the basis of this idea. Lars Eijssen and Boele 
                  Klopman were the first to actually do this, in 1991. They used 
                  a grid of 171 x 171 pixels. For their program to run 
                  through all its possible outputs would take longer than the 
                  estimated lifetime of the universe; but an ingeneous interface 
                  makes it possible to &quot;scroll ahead&quot; very effectively. <br>
                  <br>
                  The method of <i>chance art</i> can be effectively deployed 
                  in this situation: draw random samples from the set of possibilities, 
                  rather than enumerating it. In this way one quickly gets an 
                  impression of the range of possible outcomes. To sample from 
                  the set of black &amp; white pixel grids, for instance, one 
                  makes for every pixel a random choice about its colour, independently 
                  of all the other pixels. Many artists have constructed random 
                  samples of &quot;the <i>m&nbsp;x</i>&nbsp;<i>n</i> grid&quot;, 
                  for very small values of <i>m </i>and <i>n</i>; this results 
                  in the &quot;randomized checkerboards&quot; which were the icons 
                  of early chance art. (E.g.: Kelly, Morellet, De Vries, Winiarski.)<br>
                  <br>
                  Now the thing about these randomized checkerboards is, that 
                  to the human observer they all look alike. If we define the 
                  set of paintings or screen-images as the set of <i>m </i>x &nbsp;<i>n</i> pixel-grids, then virtually all of these 
                  will look the same. If the resolution is high enough, they will 
                  look like evenly grey planes. This kind of chance art thus gets 
                  <i>very</i> close to the monochrome.<br>
                  <br>
                  Chance art comes into its own when the artists vary the specification 
                  of the set of possibilities which are considered by the sampling 
                  procedure. For different series of works they tend to employ 
                  different "image grammars", which typically define a small repertoire 
                  of shapes with a small number of variable properties. The random 
                  choices must then be made within the set of possibilities specified 
                  by the image grammar. For instance: a random number of dots 
                  with randomly chosen sizes is placed on randomly chosen positions; 
                  or, a random number of lines with randomly chosen lengths and 
                  directions is placed on randomly chosen positions; or, one line 
                  is drawn through a randomly chosen sequence of points. In work 
                  like this, the promise of surprise and diversity, which is implicit 
                  in the idea of an "arbitrary image", does not pan out. The decisions 
                  of the artist (which elements, which variable parameters, what 
                  range of variation) largely determine the character of the resulting 
                  image; the random choice which is made within the constraints 
                  of the image grammar does in fact not make that much of a difference.<br>

        <blockquote><p align="left" class="serifbody">Mathematical randomness addresses 
            Kant's critique of art in a very direct way. If the esthetic insufficiency 
            of human art is caused by the unesthetic, practical considerations which 
            determine people's decisions, then we can try to avoid that problem 
            by making random artworks, which have not been subjectively constructed 
            or chosen by a human person. <br>
            <br>
            The early chance artists were content with fairly simple systems, since 
            these were sufficient to put forward the very <i>idea</i> of chance. 
            But to really take on the project of the arbitrary painting, we need 
            more; we need a formal language which allows us to assign distinct codes 
            to perceptually different paintings, but also to assign the same code 
            to perceptually equivalent paintings whose details may nevertheless 
            differ considerably (as in the case of the different instantiations 
            of Morellet's random pixels). <br>
            <br>
            Algebras like this have been developed for characterising specific styles. 
            Harold Cohen, for instance, embued his drawing program AARON with an 
            original style reminiscent of the COBRA painters. Programs which try 
            to mimic existing artists have also been developed, for instance for 
            Mir&oacute; and Diebenkorn. The 'arbitrary painting' project, however, 
            requires a system with a much richer repertoire of stylistic possibilities, 
            and with the capability to exploit those possibilities in a very flexible 
            way -- so that the degree of stylistic coherence within a painting (or 
            within an exhibition) is itself a parameter whose value can be chosen 
            at random.<br>
            <br>
            From a completely different perspective, the psychology of Gestalt perception 
            has also developed some coding languages which are relevant for our 
            purpose -- for instance, in the work by Leeuwenberg and Buffart in Nijmegen 
            on the mental representation of line drawings, and in the work by Lerdahl 
            and Jackendoff in Boston on the perception of music.<br>
            <br>
            Mathematically formulated image-generation processes can easily be combined 
            and generalized. This makes it possible to put large numbers of chance-art 
            ideas together into one super-chance-art-machine which reaches a complexity 
            that cannot be surveyed any more by individual artists.<br>
            <br>
            To take a simple example: In the chance art of the sixties one often 
            encounters programs which repeat a particular shape (usually a square 
            or a circle) in an arbitrary, unorderly manner on different positions 
            on the plane. Other, similar algorithms create arbitrary closed shapes 
            by combining line segments. These two algorithms can be combined so 
            that both the shape and the position of the image elements are determined 
            at random. Other algorithms generate a multitude of different regular 
            patterns or regular shapes; these can also be integrated. We may thus 
            gradually abolish choice, by avoiding all exclusions -- 
            by putting every choice on a par with 
            every other choice inside an all-encompassing probabilistic system. Art 
            generation systems based on this approach are being developed in the 
            project <a href="http://radicalart.info/artificial/main.html">"Artificial"</a> at the Institute 
            of Artificial Art Amsterdam.<br>
