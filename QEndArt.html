                  to him, please, how absurd that is. He is no longer a boy,
                  and ought to throw all that nonsense to the dogs. Who in our
                  days is interested in romanticism, in poetry? Give him something
                  sensible to read.&quot;<br>
&quot;What should I give him?&quot; asked Arkady. <br>
&quot;You could begin, I think, with B&uuml;chner's<em> Stoff und Kraft</em>,
for example.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;[p. 53]</p>

&quot;Everything?&quot;<br>
&quot;Everything.&quot;<br>
&quot;What? Not only art, poetry, but even . . . I hesitate to say it . . .&quot;<br>
&quot;Everything,&quot; repeated Bazarof, with indescribable calmness. <br>
              Pavel Petrovich stared at him; he had not expected such a reply;
              Arkady blushed with pleasure.<br>
&quot;But allow me, allow me,&quot; interrupted Nikolaj Petrovich; &quot;you
deny everything, or to put it more precisely, you destroy everything . . . But
it is also necessary to rebuild. . . .&quot;<br>

                  am told that in Rome our artists don't even visit the Vatican.
                  Raphael they regard as a fool, because, of course, he is an
                  authority; and these artists are themselves disgustingly sterile
                  and weak; their imagination can soar no higher than the 'Girl
                  at a Fountain' &ndash; and then even the girl is abominably
                  drawn! But you have these fellows in high esteem, I suppose?&quot;<br>

these artists aren't worth any more than he.&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;[p.

                (<em>&quot;Fathers and Sons&quot;</em>), induced him to look

            <blockquote>
              <p align="justify" class="serifbody"> [p. 167:] In the bloom of
                its strength the bourgeoisie scorned wisdom, victory and alchemy.
                Amid the glitter of power and glory it was tormented by an insatiable
                greed, by an eternal mania for acquisition and accumulation.
                [...] The bourgeoisie acquired. Everything that became its property
                bowed to it. <br>
              But suddenly on its fabulous path of advance, it came across a
              certain obstacle. It could not buy nature, the invisible world,
              the world in its immensity, the sky, the stars, eternity. They
              are not available for personal posession, they are not transferable
              into private property. [p. 168:] And a feeling of dissatisfaction,
              of a cold vacuum, stole into the sensitive heart of the bourgeoisie.
              It was consumed by a feeling of insatiable hunger. Tormented by
              the grief of the property owner who has been unjustly insulted,
              tortured by the bitter disappointment of the industrialist who
              has realized that his business cannot encompass everything, the
              bourgeois sought ways to oblivion. Narcotics became a necessity.
              Refreshing illusion was required.<br>
              They thought of a surrogate, of their own creation of genius, of
              their favorite <em>Wunderkind</em> of industrial ingenuity. [...]
              They decided to prepare a surrogate for the universe. And so, to
              this end, a very chic and remarkable theory was made and elaborated
              that saw the real and unreal worlds, the visible and the invisible
              worlds, as incarnated in the divine work of art. Aesthetes and
              poets [...] dressed up the artist in the dunce's cap of the medieval
              magician, wizard, and alchemist. They forced him to perform a kind
              of sorcery, a supernatural divination, a magic transubstantiation.
              [p. 169:] And an ulterior force was ascribed to all the things
              that were made by this kind of duped artist. They asserted and
              professed conscientiously: &quot;The eternal harmony of the builder
              of the universe is reflected in the eternal beauty of artistic
              forms. Works of art reflect the world, the outer, material, inner,
              spiritual, and ideal nature of things, the essence and latent meaning
              of things.&quot; <br>
              This splendid theory was elaborated beautifully by the great experts.
              [...] It did not occur to anybody that this was not the genuine
              article, but merely a surrogate, a jolly good fake. The highest
              goal of bourgeois aspirations had been attained. [...] The right
              of private property had been extended to the extreme limits of
              eternity. It crawled all over the planets, all over the stars near
              and far. It flowed throughout the Milky Way. Like sugar icing,
              it glossed all over the belly of eternity. An unprecedented, world-wide
              achievement had been wrought. The bourgeoisie had colonized the &quot;ulterior
              world.&quot;<br>
              Step by step we are depriving the imperialist bourgeoisie of its
              global annexations. Only so far the proletariat has not lifted
              its hand against this most miraculous annexation of the spirit.
              Because the bourgeoisie put this valuable and prosperous colony
              under the lock and key of mysterious, mystical forces &ndash; and
              even the revolutionary spirit of our time retreats before them. <br>
              It is time to shake off this shameful yoke. [...] [p. 170:] Socialism
              must destroy the black and white magic of the industrialists and
              merchants. [...] To the socialist consciousness, a work of art
              is no more than an object, a thing. </p>

            <p align="justify">Echoing Joseph
              Kosuth (and parodying Hegel as well as Greenberg),
              Arthur Danto  has proposed a  simple teleological model of the
              dynamics of art history: art was
              a cultural tradition with a  definite 
              aim, which was: to understand the nature of art. Obviously, this
              aim was achieved when  artists and  audience first understood
              that art is a cultural tradition which aims at understanding its
              own nature. Supposedly, this historical event occurred
              in 1964, when  Andy Warhol first presented his
              <em>Brillo Boxes</em> &ndash; or perhaps in 1974, when Arthur
              Danto first explained this. (Or perhaps in 1914, when Marcel Duchamp
              bought his <em>Bottle Rack</em>?) </p>

          <p align="justify" class="serifbody">We have entered a period&nbsp; of
            art so absolute in its freedoms that art seems but a name for an
            infinite play with its own concept: as though Schelling's thought
            of an end state of history as &quot;a universal ocean of poetry&quot; were
            a prediction come true. Artmaking is its own end in both sense[s]
            of the term: the end of art is the end of art. There is no further
            place to go. [...] Having reached this point, where art can be anything
            at all, art has exhausted its conceptual mission. </p>

            Duchamp (the imaginary), Rodchenko
                  (the real), and Mondrian (the symbolic), among others, all
            believed in the end &ndash; they all had the final truth, all spoke
            apocalyptically. Yet has the end come? To say no (painting is still
            alive, just look at the galleries) is undoubtedly an act of denial,
            for it has never been more evident that most paintings one sees have
                  abandoned the task that historically belonged to modern painting
                  (that, precisely, of working through the end of painting) and
                  are simply artifacts created for the market and by the market
                  (absolutely interchangeable artifacts created by interchangeable
                  producers). To say yes, however, that the end has come, is
            to give in to a historicist conception of history as both linear
                  and total (i.e., one cannot paint after Duchamp, Rodchenko,
            Mondrian; their work has rendered paintings unnecessary, or: one
            cannot paint anymore in the era of the mass media, computer games,
            and the simulacrum).</p>
