            <p align="left"><font face="Verdana">In algorithmic art 
              in the true sense of that word, the artwork is the algorithm. The 
              artistic value of an algorithm is not necessarily purely conceptual, 
              however. Algorithmic art often bridges (or short-circuits) the gap 
              between the conceptual and the &quot;retinal&quot;, when the observer 
              is confronted with a surprising or puzzling relation between the 
              algorithm and its visual output &#150; for instance, when a simple 
              procedure yields a complex result, or when a seemingly random process 
              creates striking regularities. This is the art of &quot;emergence&quot;: 
              to explore the discrepancies between what is programmed and what 
              is observed; to initiate the &quot;spontaneous&quot; generation 
              of form out of iterated local interactions. <br>
              <br>
              The phenomenon of &quot;Moir&eacute; patterns&quot; is an early 
              instance of emergent form: the  superposition of two simple 
              patterns gives rise to a new, more complex pattern which is unrelated 
              to each of its constituents: it is an interference pattern, generated 
              by the <i>interaction</i> between the constituents.<br>
              <br>
              The earliest computer art (1960's), also often demonstrates emergent 
              patterns. For instance, an iteration loop repeats a simple shape 
              while transforming it by translation, rotation, scaling, etc.; the 
              result is a new Gestalt which is not perceived in terms of the elementary 
              shapes that constitute it.<br>
              <br>
              More complex algorithms displaying this kind of behaviour are developed 
              in the context of recently developed scientific disciplines such 
              as <i>Computational Mathematics</i> and <i>Artificial Life.</i></font></p>

  'Moir&eacute;' is a French word meaning 'watery' or 'watered silk' 
                and has now been adopted in English. Watered silk and mohair fabric 
                have an appearance that is both shimmery and like the grain of wood. 
                That such patterns could be produced with a pair of diffraction gratings 
                was pointed out by Lord Rayleigh in 1874, who also mentioned that 
                the principle could be useful in making accurate measurements. (. 
                . .) <br>
              <br>
              A diffraction grating is a transparency with ruled parallel lines 
            so close they cannot be seen with the naked eye. But if two such gratings 
            are superimposed, with slightly different rulings, a pattern analogous 
            to the beats of sound becomes entirely visible, in fact a good alternative 
            name for moir&eacute; patterns would be 'visible beats'. One is provoked 
                to conjecture that the fundamental nature of matter is based on such 
                a principle. Perhaps all we can observe in nature are moir&eacute; fringes produced by something analogous to diffraction gratings in 
                which the distances between adjacent lines are so small that there 
                is no method known for their direct observation, even with an electron 
                microscope. This suggestion would fit in well with the theory of 'winding 
                space', where space is assumed not to close in on itself but to just 
              miss, that is, instead of being a hypersphere it is a sort of hyper-helix.</p>
