                <br>
                John Simon's Java-applet &quot;Every Icon&quot; (1996) enumerates 
                  all patterns which are possible in a 32 by 32 grid of pixels which 
                  may be colored black or white. <br>
                <br>
&quot;Every Icon&quot; was displayed in many gallery exhibitions. 
                  Several of its instantiations can also be witnessed online through 
                  any Java-compatible browser.<br>
                <br>
                Customized copies of the applet are created on demand; they can 
                be ordered online through the artist's website. A customized applet 
                starts its enumeration at the moment of its creation.The buyer 
                of an applet receives the code for a web-page which can be used 
              to put it online. Examples of web-pages in this format are </p>

                The buyer of an applet receives a license agreement (see below) 
                which looks pretty much like a standard software license agreement. 
                For the connoisseur of modern art it also resonates with the certificates 
                written by the conceptual and minimal artists of the sixtities and 
                seventies to turn their mental and immaterial artworks into tradable 
                commodities. (Knight (1988) shows such certificates by Robert Barry, 
                Donald Judd, Sol LeWitt, Walter De Maria, Bruce Naumann, and James 
                Turrell.)<br>
                  <br>
                  Watching the program in action, one may 
                  wonder: Does it indeed generate all possible 32 x 32 pixel configurations? 
                  Does it generate each of them exactly once? To answer that question, 
                  is to &quot;reverse-engineer&quot; the program: to guess the underlying 
                  algorithm by analysing the program's observed behaviour.<br>
                <br>
                Jochem van der Spek's program &quot;Borges.C&quot; (1993) has 
                  a functionality very similar to &quot;Every Icon&quot;. Van der 
                  Spek reports that his algorithm for the 32 x 32 case would work 
              as follows:  </p>
            </div>
            <blockquote>
              <div align="left">
                <p>Consider all possible bit strings 
                  of length 1024. Notice that these can be read as denoting the 
                  numbers 0 through 2^1024 &#150; 1 (in a notation with leading 
                  0's). We can therefore generate all these numbers by starting 
                  with 0 (i.e. 1024 0's) and adding 1 until we have reached the 
                  number which is writtten as a sequence of 1024 1's. Stipulate 
                  that 0 means white and 1 means black, and write each number in 
                  a 32 x 32 grid, in right-to-left, bottom-to-top fashion (&quot;backwards&quot;, 
                  least significant bits first). This process generates all possible 
                  patterns by the simple process of binary counting. It starts with 
                  small patterns in the upper left corner and gradually extends 
                  them, first to the right, then to the next line, etc.</p>

                      In its core meaning, &quot;reverse engineering&quot; is the

                      paradoxical for a conceptual artist to impose limitations

              <p>The idea of enumerating all possible pixel grids 
                was developed and implemented independently by several artists. (We list them on our page about <a href="../index.html">&quot;Every Grid&quot;</a>.
                The first piece of this sort that we know of is&nbsp;&quot;The 
                Wishing Well&quot;&nbsp;by 
                Lars Eijssen &amp; Boele Klopman (1991). It displays and prints 
                all configurations of a 172 by 172 black &amp; white pixel grid, 
                and includes a graphical interface for &quot;looking into the 
                future&quot; and an &quot;inverse mapping&quot; which calculates 
                for any input picture when it will be produced. It generates the 
                images in a different order than &quot;Every Icon&quot;: after 
                the empty image, first all images with 1 black pixel, then all 
                images with 2 black pixels, etc.<br>
                <br>
                Other, more limited pieces in the same genre were done by Jochem 
                van der Spek (&quot;Borges.C&quot;, 1993) and by Leander Seige 
                (<a href="http://imagen.hgb-leipzig.de/">&quot;Imagen&quot;</a>, 
                2000). The unique quality of John Simon's &quot;Every Icon&quot; is its availability as a Java-applet.<br>
                <br>
                The idea of enumerating all possible pixel grids has a definite 
                relation with the &quot;random pixel grids&quot; done by artists 
                such as Ellsworth Kelly (1951), Fran&ccedil;ois Morellet (1961), 
                and herman de vries (1970). These are discussed in our page on <a href="../../any/index.html"><i>&quot;Any Grid&quot; </i></a>.<br>
                <br>
                The idea of enumerating all possible pixel grids is an instance 
                of a more general notion of <a href="../../../enumeration/index.html">&quot;enumeration 
                art&quot; </a>which can also be carried out without computers. 
                Sol LeWitt, for instance, made many works in this genre.<br>
                <br>
&quot;Every Icon&quot; was inspired by an early Macintosh &quot;icon-editor&quot;. 
                A similar program is Aaron Neugebauer's <i><a href="http://entries.the5k.org/967/index.html">PixelPaint</a></i> 
                (2002). A 3D version of the same idea is one of the modes of operation 
                of the program <a href="http://entries.the5k.org/209/index.html"> 
                <i>Blocks</i></a><i>,</i> written by Wouter De Jong and Roy Tanck 
                in 2000.</p>
